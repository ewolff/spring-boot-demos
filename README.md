Some Spring Boot Demos
======================

This project contains some demos for Spring Boot

* simplest-spring-boot is a very simple project. It just shows how a web application can be created.
* spring-boot-spring-data-jpa adds support for Spring Data JPA and Thymleaf templates.
* spring-boot-ops shows features for ops - you can go to http://localhost:8080/actuator/ - that JSON document contains links to some resources for monitoring.
